# Clean
This repository contains the "Clean" application written in a myriad of different programming languages. Clean is a simple command-line utility that removes useless files left behind in the user's home directory by many applications on the Linux operating system.

I write this application as a first excercise when learning a new language because it uses a good bunch of basic language functionality / features.

Currently, there are implementations in:
- Crystal
- Nim <3
- Odin
- Go
